**Script of Final Pitching:**

Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. I’m Angus from Nawah. I'm thrilled to introduce CathayConnect, the ultimate travel companion revolutionizing your travel experiences with value-added services. With CathayConnect, designing an astonishing adventure is only a click away. 
 
Before delving into the app, let's first address the existing problems for trip planning.  
One significant issue is the lack of a comprehensive platform. Travellers struggle to find a single platform for seamless planning and tracking of their trips. This fragmented experience lowers overall satisfaction. 
 
Secondly, travellers face difficulties in visualizing collected data. Creating a timetable and budget plan involves tedious input processes of cost and time data, causing unnecessary hassle.  
 
Lastly, travellers lack personalized suggestions. Trip references posted are not customised to their preferences. While solutions like ChatGPT provide assistance, the responsibility of rearranging trip data still falls on the user. In light of these challenges, we proudly present CathayConnect. 
 
CathayConnect incorporates all the services and information you need, ranging from flight bookings, hotels, activities, to real-time information on attractions through partnerships with service providers. 
 
Moreover, CathayConnect provides tools that simplify your trip-planning experience. Our app includes a budget planner, timetable, to-bring list, and timeline. Booking data are automatically rearranged into tools to provide a comprehensive view, saving a lot of your precious time. 
 
Taking it a step further, CathayConnect is powered by AI. We leverage Azure (air sir) Open AI Service to access ChatGPT and Azure AI Search. This empowers our app to entertain requests and provide intelligent recommendations using data from service providers and online sources. Once the suggestions are adopted, they can immediately be included in the tool interfaces, which is literally designing a trip with a click. On top of that, the suggestions given can be customized according to user preferences. 
 
In conclusion, CathayConnect offers a comprehensive solution to trip planning. Therefore, we anticipate a significant number of travellers making bookings through our app, promoting the Cathay brand and generating commission earnings. While our understanding of customer preferences will give us an edge in market campaigns. Experience CathayConnect firsthand in our demo session and witness its transformative power for your travel adventures.
